<h2> Welcome to my homepage! </h2>

<p> Here is Miao Hu. I hold a Master of Science from the department of physics and astronomy at Heidelberg University, Germany. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Trent University, Canada, major in physics and minor in mathematics, and at Tianjin Normal University, China, learning astrophysics. </p>

<br />

<p> My <a href="research"> research interests </a> are centered around the mathematical theories of various questions in statistical mechanics, quantum information, classical electrodynamics, and astrophysics. Such as: </p>

<ul>
    <li> Quantum field theory </li>
    <li> Random matrix theory </li>
    <li> Optical cavity theory </li>
    <li> Cosmological inflation </li>
</ul>
